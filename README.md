# Etest Web Application using MVC pattern

## Description and functionalities

EtestWebApp is an ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application. Users log in using Windows Authenticaton. 
Users choose Tests to solve and Surveys to submit their answers to. After choosing
the test, the user can navigate through questions thanks to the navigation bar left
to the question, changing their answer if they wish to. After clicking Finish, 
the user is redirected to view their score of the test or a Thank You message for 
answering the survey. Users can create new tests. After creating a test the page 
redirects to adding a question to the said test, and then adding answers do the said 
question. The Statistics button allows users to see how many users have gotten the grades 5-10.
- Few functionalities that can be worked on: the radio button of the selected answer stays 
checked throughout the whole test-survey; questions can be multiple choice.
